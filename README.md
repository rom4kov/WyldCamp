### WyldCamp

WyldCamp is an encompassing website project inspired by sites like Yelp and Airbnb. Registered users can create and review campgrounds. The project is based on Colt Steele's web development bootcamp course available on Udemy.

The development of WyldCamp employs a robust tech stack including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap and EJS with authentication managed through Passport.js.

#### Functionalities

Locations of campgrounds can be seen on a map at the top of the main page. Clicking on a dot on the map opens a popup with a link to the particular campground. Campgrounds can also be searched on the main page.
